    Participative coding (« Sprints »)

    The first two days are dedicated to sprints.

    Developers of various open source projects gather in little groups to code
    together. Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we seek to guide beginners.

    Take part to the development of your favorite project! We provide the space and
    environment (tables, chairs, internet connection... and coffee!).
